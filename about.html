        <h3 class="row">Quarantinediary.ai is a web diary co-authored by the artist and a Neural Network model trained by selected online articles published during COVID-19 self isolation. Each new visit of the site triggers part of the diary to be rewritten dynamically. The buddhist metaphor of Indra’s Net states that “In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be an infinite network of pearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it.” Quarantinediary.ai depicts how the Networked Self is inevitably felt upon and reciprocated during COVID-19. We have always shaped and will keep shaping each other's presence, consciously or otherwise.

        <h3>quarantinediary.ai by Zhenzhen Qi was commissioned as part of the ENTER program by Onassis USA, curated by NEW INC, New Museum, completed within 120 hours during the COVID-19 pandemic.
